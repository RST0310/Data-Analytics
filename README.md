# Data-Analytics

This project is a component of my master's program's Data Analytics course I was responsible for 75% of the work. Python 3 was used to assess a player's performance using cricket statistics. My major goal was to assess a player's performance based on his statistics and evaluate whether he needed to participate in any training or fitness sessions if his performance was steadily declining.

This project is performed on Jupyter Notebook with the programming language as python.
